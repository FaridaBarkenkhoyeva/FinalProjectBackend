5. user creates endevaluation of patients treatment flow and share 7. user can check sessions and patient list from dashboard 8. user can plan the schedule 9. user can sign-up and log in

2. Backend:
   with endpoints and variables
   postman for the endpoints
   organize the project into files => start splitting into folder from the start!
   build/text the functions (get all post / rent a car)
   setup CORS for frontend calls
   migrate data
3. Database: sql, sequelize
   create car table and convert all controllers "not related to renting"
   create rent table and convert ...

4. Frontend:
   Struction the project (components, pages, layouts...)
   setup (router, context api, tailwind, daisyUI)
   setup CORS on the backend
   run the endpoints one by one starting form cars => rent

Phases

- Phase 1
  user can create intake with initiated data, for new patient.
  Patient = {"id" (PK), "surname", "lastname", "phoneNumber", "email", "insurance number", gender, DoB, occupation}
  
  Intake=
  {
  "Id",
  "Status": {pending, in progress, completed}
  "patientId",
  "Chief Complaint ID",
  "Medical History",
  "Musculoskeletal / Injury History",
  "Functional Status",
  "Lifestyle Factors",
  "Family & Social History",
  "Patient Goals",
  "Therapist Notes"
  }

Chief Complaint = {"id", "intakeId", "Primary reason for visit",
"Onset of symptoms",
"Duration",
"Pain level (0â€“10)}"

Medical History ={"ID", "intakeId","Past illnesses / conditions",
"Surgeries",
"Current medications",
"Allergies"}

Musculoskeletal / Injury History = { ID, intakeId,
previous injuries,
fractures / sprains / dislocations,
Chronic pain conditions }

Functional Status = { id, intakeId
Daily activities affected,
Mobility level (independent/assisted),
Use of aids (cane, walker, wheelchair, orthotics)}

Lifestyle Factors = { id, intakeId
Physical activity / exercise routine,
Work demands ,
Hobbies / sports"}

work demands: {sedentary, heavy labor, repetitive tasks} (just selectible feature)

Family & Social History = { id, intakeId
Relevant family medical history,
Social habits (smoking, alcohol, etc.)
}

Patient Goals ={ id, intakeId
Short-term goals,
Long-term goals }

Therapist Notes = { id, intakeId,
Observations,
Additional comments }

Backend Routes

// create patient (1 time), then create intake, next time a patient visits for another treatment case, you create a new intake for the same patient. 

post : /api/patients (create patient ) apply api's 
get : /api/patients (get a list of all patients)
get : /api/patients/:id (get one specific patient by id)
post : /api/intakes/:patientId (create intake for existing patient)
get : /api/intakes/:id (get created intake)

get : /api/intakes (get only active intakes)
get : /api/intakes/all (get all intakes)
get : /api/intakes/completed (get only completed intakes)
get : /api/intakes/:patientId (get all intakes from patientId)


might be implemented in future phases:
put :/api/intakes/:id (update intake)
delete : /api/intakes/:id (delete intake)
post : /api/intakes (create intake from non existent patient)


front-end pages
wireframe miro prompt
create a wireframe for physiotherapist. layout: simple, professional and minimal, more blueish of color. First page is dashboard, left side of dashboard ; a list of active patients, on the right side is weekly schedule. 
Physio can create a patient (Patient = {"id" (PK), "surname", "lastname", "phoneNumber", "email", "insurance number", gender, DoB, occupation}) by adding with button in dashboard, this adds patient to list of patients and jumps to next screen: patient intake form. (Intake=
  {
  "Id",
  "patientId",
  "Chief Complaint ID",
  "Medical History",
  "Musculoskeletal / Injury History",
  "Functional Status",
  "Lifestyle Factors",
  "Family & Social History",
  "Patient Goals",
  "Therapist Notes"
  })



- Phase 2
  user can create and add assessments to patientCase
  Assessment = {"patientId", "Date", "observation & inspection", "ROM", "MST", "Neurological Screening", "Functional Tests", "Special Tests (As Needed)", "Pain Assessment", "Therapist Notes"}

- Phase 3
  user to create goals and plan for patient

`treatment_plans` = {"numberOfSessions", "shortTermGoals", "longTermGoals", "plannedInterventions", "additionalGoals"}

  endReport = {patient, intake,
  "Assessments",
  "treatment_Plans"
  }
